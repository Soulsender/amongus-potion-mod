# Amongus Potion Mod (FABRIC ONLY)

This is a shitpost mod I made for fun as an intro to modding. I wanted an entity that was simple to make.

### Installation

This mod depends on [Geckolib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib/files) for **FABRIC.** This mod will not work on Forge. You will also need the [FabricAPI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files).

Download the correct .jar files for you version of minecraft, and drop them into your .minecraft mods directory. There are plenty of tutorials on how to do this. Do the same for the right version of Amongus-Potion. You can view the releases [here](https://github.com/Soulsender/amongus-potion-mod/releases).

I'll write a script to automate this at some point as well.

Forge page available [here](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amongus-potion-from-the-dark-web/files).
